This Amiga-based shared library was created to make it easier for application
programmers to include clickable URLs in their applications, about windows, etc.
Current solutions to this problem typically are to launch an ARexx script
or just support a few webbrowsers, with no room for configuration. This
leads to countless reinventions of the wheel (how many `SendURLToBrowser.rexx`
scripts do you have on your harddisk?).

This library solves the problem by giving application programmers a very
simple API to handle (one function) and the user gets configurability with
the included preferences program.

OpenURL is available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.
